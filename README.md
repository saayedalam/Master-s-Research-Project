## Master's Research Project Proposal

# 1.	Description of The Problem

On the first quarter of 2019, my sister got married in Newcastle, United Kingdom. As often the case during a wedding, numerous financial transactions were made. During one such urgent matter, my debit card was declined. It was embarrassing to say the least but more importantly it delayed several wedding activities.   

In the moment I was not thinking about the data science that determined my fate. Even though it was disheartening, this fraud prevention system is saving consumers millions of dollars per year.  

Researchers from the [IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Computational_Intelligence_Society) want to improve this figure, while also improving the customer experience. They are partnering with the world’s leading payment service company, [Vesta Corporation](https://trustvesta.com/), seeking the best solutions for fraud prevention industry, and they have invited data scientists to join the challenge on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview). 

# 2.	Why It’s Interesting

There are two main reasons for picking this problem. First, I believe this problem is sufficiently challenging that it serves as a good demonstration of what I have mastered in the program. In this competition, I’ll benchmark machine learning models on a challenging large-scale dataset. The data comes from Vesta’s real-world e-commerce transactions and contains wide range of features from device type to product features. I also can create new features to improve my results.   

Second, I had only one white-collar job in my career and this is exactly what I did. Before I started working on my bachelor’s program, I was hired as an office assistant at an ecommerce payment solutions company. Through hard work I soon became their junior data analyst, manually verifying over $10K worth of transactions per day.  

I believe this project brings my career full circle. With master’s program, this capstone project coupled with my only job experience, I can land a job in the financial sector. 

# 3.	What Other Approaches 

Within a year, the field of machine learning and data science have advanced so much. I believe with this advancement and my knowledge of the domain; I can apply new algorithms and tools such as TensorFlow to improve or solve the problem. 

[ClearSale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClearSale), a large fraud management company from Brazil with customers such as Sony, Walmart and others; recently posted a blog. In this blog they state, [“the biggest e-commerce challenge of 2019 may be balancing marketing and sales channel innovation with the need for increasingly sophisticated fraud prevention.”](https://blog.clear.sale/do-we-have-enough-data-scientists-to-protect-against-e-commerce-fraud)

It is evident there is lot of room for improvement in fraud prevention, I hope to contribute my expertise and knowledge to this noble cause.
